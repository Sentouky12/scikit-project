# First things first

## Why Python
- Python provides an intuitive syntax that facilitates debugging and focusing on the research project.

- Python is an open-source languagee that has witnessed a [steady gowth](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python/) since the 2000s.

- Python provides a rich ecosystem of excellent libraries for numerical and scientific investigations, such as Numpy, Scipy, Matplolib, and Cython.

- Python libraries are generated by an inclusive, grassroot community of developers. Most of the Python open-source libraries are maintained by volunteers, often academic researchers in the case of scientific computing.    

## Before starting coding 

- Install Python. Mac machines currently come with Python 2.x already installed. 
Since most scientific libraries in the Python ecosystem have made plans to stop supporting Python 2.x distributions, it is better to install a 3.x version. 

- Download Python 3.x with `pip` or `conda`. Pip is the Python Package Index and helps manage installations. 
Anaconda is a package manager that comes with a bundle of libraries. For most cases downloading `miniconda`, which is an essential version of Anaconda, a lighter version from the Terminal and with only a limited number of libraries, might work.

- Download `git`. Git is a language for version control and continuous integration. git can be downloaded at [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/).

- Set up a GitHub personal account. You can use this to manage your folders ("repositories"), copy code, download it and upload it, allowing other users to collaborate to the same project. 
GitHub is not the only project allowing this, another less popular project is GitLab.

### Syncing git
Sync GitHub with your computer using `git`: 
- [Create a repository on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/) and then add sync it with your machine.  

## Using git

There are a few basic concepts to start using git, and they involve some jargon, as for GitHub. 

`git init`: Move to a given folder from the Terminal, such as `cd Dropbox/dev/` and tell `git` that this folder needs to be initialized. 

`git status`: Check the status of your folder with respect to the origin (which is the folder on GitHub). You can always set what is your [remote](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-remote/) repository locally.  

`git add .`: After you have made your changes to the files of your folder (repository) on your machine, you want to add all this changes to the modification you want to submit (commit). 

`git commit -m "your comment"`: you are submitting a modification in a bundle (commit) and you are commenting the modification for your records (a track of this changes will be available in the repository history). 

`git pull`: this command downloads the current version of the repository (master or branch) to your local machine, e.g. with `git pull origin master`;

`git push <branch>`: this command uploads the current version of your local repository to the online copy, e.g. with `git push origin master`;

`git checkout -b <new-branch>`: Create a new branch; moving from the `master` to a brandch is equivalent to taking a diversion from the main route, in order to do some changes without affecting the core project, at least yet. 

`git merge <branch>`: Once you are satisfied with the changes, you are ready to merge the branch back into the master and eventually you can delete the branch.
