## Before starting coding 

- Install Python. Mac machines currently come with Python 2.x already installed. 
Since most scientific libraries in the Python ecosystem have made plans to stop supporting Python 2.x distributions, it is better to install a 3.x version. 

- Download Python 3.x with `pip` or `conda`. Pip is the Python Package Index and helps manage installations. 
Anaconda is a package manager that comes with a bundle of libraries. For most cases downloading `miniconda`, which is an essential version of Anaconda, a lighter version from the Terminal and with only a limited number of libraries, might work.

- Download `git`. Git is a language for version control and continuous integration. git can be downloaded at [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/).

- Set up a GitHub personal account. You can use this to manage your folders ("repositories"), copy code, download it and upload it, allowing other users to collaborate to the same project. 
GitHub is not the only project allowing this, another less popular project is GitLab.

- Sync GitHub with your computer using `git`. 


## Using git

There are a few basic concepts to start using git. 

`git init`

`git add`

`git commit`

`git pull` 

`git push` 

`git merge`

## Why Python
- Python provides an intuitive syntax that facilitates debugging and focusing on the research project.

- Python is an open-source languagee that has witnessed a [steady gowth](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python/) since the 2000s.

- Python provides a rich ecosystem of excellent libraries for numerical and scientific investigations, such as Numpy, Scipy, Matplolib, and Cython.
