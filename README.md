# Scientific Open-Source Library Guide

A cheatsheet to develop a scientific open-source library from scratch.

Here you will find information to design, build, and release an open-source library to perform scientific research in Python from scratch to finish.


[Before Starting Coding](1-code.md): Setting up the environment on your machine, including the tools you will need to write code efficiently. Some information about the Python and open source ecosystem, and how they relate to open science are also given. 

[Developing your Project](2-develop.md): A step-by-step guide with best practices for coding, and tips for making code development as effortless as possible.  

[Testing](3-test.md): Especially in software related to scientific research, at start, the destination is not always crystal clear. Code is written, optimized, reorganized. Unit testing is a crucial task to avoid getting lost in the process.  

[Documentation](4-docs.md): "Code is more often read than written" said Guido Van Rossum, the creator of Python. This is especially true for collaborative projects in the scientific research space, in which researchers might interact with code in a delocalized manner, at different times, and on different time scales. Making good comments of features, from functions to classes, allows one to generate with little effort a full fledged online documentation, drastically increasing the rate of adoption.    

[Publishing](5-publish.md): It's time to release your library. Making importing your library easy is a key feature for its users, potential future contributors. Several tools now allow to deploy code in a variety of environments. As researchers, you are also interested in getting the best out of your research effort, gauging how to publish the research results derived from it. Some examples are given, especially relevant for physicists working in quantum technology.

This project stems from a series of talks, lectures, material developed in relation to the QuTiP (Quantum Toolbox in Python) library and open source in quantum-tech research. The aim is to provide useful information in a concentric way, starting from the quantum-tech research community, to the physics, academic and in general scientific community engaging with open-source software.
