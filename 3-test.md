# Testing your code

Shahnawaz Ahmed once told me that his professor once told the class that "untested code is broken code". Well, that's true. 


## Testing locally: writing the tests
- Set up a file with your testing function. Ideally, each function should have a test function. 

## Testing locally: automated tests
- Set up a testing script. There are a couple of options, nose, nose2 and pytest.  

## Automated cloud testing
- Set up Travis CI. This continuous integration tool checks that your GitHub is always passing the tests according to the specifics set up by you.
That is, Travis CI every time installs from scratch all the dependencies on a clean machine.
