# 0 - First things first

## 0.1 - Open Source and Open Science
- In recent years, open-source software has become an ever increasing important solution in the architecture of software infrastructure, spilling from its niche of core developers to the world of [business](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/12/how-open-source-software-took-over-the-world/) to that of research and development. 

- Open-source software aligns with the goals of open science, which aims to remove any barrier to knowledge in research and the dissemination of scientific results. 

- Making supporting data freely and easily available makes reproducibility tests easier. Eve more, open-source libraries (where a library is a self-contained software package) make code reusable. The shift from just aiming at reproducible data to providing [reusable code](http://gael-varoquaux.info/programming/beyond-computational-reproducibility-let-us-aim-for-reusability.html) can reshape the way scientific discovery is performed.     

- Some of the recent incentives in academia have leaned toward competition and personal achievements, from the focus on metrics of published papers to personal citations. Open-source libraries can in many cases realign collaboration and cooperation with scientific progress.  

## 0.2 - Why Python
- Python provides an intuitive syntax that facilitates debugging and focusing on the research project.

- Python is an open-source language that has witnessed a [steady gowth](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python/) since the 2000s.

- Python provides a rich ecosystem of excellent libraries for numerical and scientific investigations, such as Numpy, Scipy, Matplolib, and Cython.

- Python libraries are generated by an inclusive, grassroot community of developers. Most of the Python open-source libraries are maintained by volunteers, often academic researchers in the case of scientific computing.    

## 0.3 - Before starting coding 

- Install Python. Mac machines currently come with Python 2.x already installed. 
Since most scientific libraries in the Python ecosystem have made plans to stop supporting Python 2.x distributions, it is better to install a 3.x version. 

- Download Python 3.x with `pip` or `conda`. Pip is the Python Package Index and helps manage installations. 
Anaconda is a package manager that comes with a bundle of libraries. For most cases downloading `miniconda`, which is an essential version of Anaconda, a lighter version from the Terminal and with only a limited number of libraries, might work.

- Download `git`. Git is a language for version control and continuous integration. git can be downloaded at [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/).

- Set up a GitHub personal account. You can use this to manage your folders ("repositories"), copy code, download it and upload it, allowing other users to collaborate to the same project. 
GitHub is not the only project allowing this, another less popular project is GitLab.
