# 5 - Documentation for your code

## 5.1 - Comment your functions

## 5.2 - Sphinx

Use [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/) to generate an API documentation automatically from the comments present in the .py scripts. You can embellish the API with a User Guide, by writing some specific 

Inter-Sphinx is a feature of Sphyinx that creates an hypertext with functions and classes defined in other documentations. For example, you can make every instance of `np.linspace()` in your library's documentation clickable, so that a user can learn of its parameters, output and features directly on NumPy's documentation page. 

## 5.3 - Use readthedocs to host online the documentation 

[Read the docs](https://readthedocs.org/) allows you to host the technical documentation of your library for free at the website `mylibrary.readthedocs.org`.
